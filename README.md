## pydis51
A Python-based Disassembler for Intel HEX Files Targeting the 8051 Microcontroller Architecture

### Description
pydis51 is a disassembler written in Python that converts Intel HEX files into human-readable assembly instructions for the MCS-51 microcontroller family (also known as the 8051). The MCS-51 series, originally developed by Intel in 1980, has been widely used in embedded systems.

### FEATURES
- Parses Intel HEX format files as input
- Generates corresponding 8051 assembly code
- Displays instruction histogram
- Shows the distribution of different instruction types
   
### INPUT/OUTPUT
- Input: Intel HEX format file
- Output: Assembly language file (.asm)
